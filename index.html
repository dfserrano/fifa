      <p>The following visualizations show the players of each of the countries that will be playing the FIFA World Cup
        Russia 2018.</p>
      <p>The players are organized as if they form a constellation of stars, by using dimensionality reduction called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Princial Component Analysis (PCA)</a>.
        With these technique I could represent more than 30 skills of the players (for example, acceleration, ball control, dribbling, speed, etc.)
        into a 2-D plane.  The main goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality, while retaining the variation present in the dataset, up to the maximum extent.
      </p>
      <p>Hence, having one player as a reference, for example Messi, we would say that players close to him are also good players, while
        players who are far from them may not be as good.
