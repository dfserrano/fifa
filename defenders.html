                <p>The visualization shows the defensive players of each of the countries that will be playing the FIFA World Cup
                  Russia 2018.</p>
                <p>The players are organized as if they form a constellation of stars, by using dimensionality reduction called
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Princial Component Analysis (PCA)</a>.
                  With these technique I could represent more than 30 skills of the players (for example, acceleration, ball control, dribbling, speed, etc.)
                  into a 2-D plane.  The main goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality, while retaining the variation present in the dataset, up to the maximum extent.
                </p>
                <p>Hence, having Sergio Ramos as a reference (top-center), we would say that players close to him are also good defenders, while
                  defenders who are far from them may not be as good.  Then, we can see that Germany has probably the best defenders.

          <td scope="col">
            <p>From the dataset, I selected the top-3 players, based on the overall score, for each country participating in
              the World Cup.</p>
            <p>Only the players that contain any of the following positions were considered: CB (center back), LCB (left center back),
              RCB (right center back.</p>
            <p>Then, all the attributes that are not part of the profile information, such as strength and stamina, are standardized
              and fed into the PCA algorithm.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, the positions are adjusted in order to have top players at the top-center area of the screen, which
              is more intuitive for final users.</p>
            <p>More details can be deduced from the source code.</p>
